		<p class="intro">A bunch of text that is probably supposed to be Lorem Ipsum, but I just can't bring myself to do that because it's the convention.  Instead I prefer my ya da ya da, blah blah blah...  Not nearly as professional, but that's okay for this.  The point is to have enough text rambling along that it can serve as a placeholder.  I can do that on ny own without having to bring in the repeating latin.  Good enough.
